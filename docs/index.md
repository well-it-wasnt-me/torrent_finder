# torrent_finder documentation

`torrent_finder` automates the hunt for the "best" torrent by pulling results from a Torznab/Jackett
endpoint, ranking the candidates, and handing the winner directly to Transmission. The project favors
simple configuration, readable logging, and a workflow that you can script or invoke ad-hoc.

## Key capabilities

- Query Torznab/Jackett feeds and score candidates by seeders and leechers.
- Apply defaults from `config.json` but allow one-off CLI overrides.
- Dispatch the chosen magnet to Transmission via RPC or `transmission-remote`.

## Command-line pit stop

```bash
python main.py "The Big Lebowski" \
  --config config.json \
  --start \
  --categories "2000,5000"
```

## What you'll find here

- A quick path to installation and verification.
- Guidance on shaping `config.json` for Torznab, Transmission, Telegram, and logging.
- Usage patterns for the CLI and Telegram bot, plus an API overview for extending the toolkit.
