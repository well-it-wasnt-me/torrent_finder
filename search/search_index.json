You only need to supply a title, but most configuration fields can be overridden per invocation. Basic search \u00b6 python main.py \"Drunken Master\" The command above loads config.json from the project root, queries the configured Torznab feed, logs the ranked candidates, and sends the top magnet to Transmission using the defaults defined in the configuration file. Command-line options \u00b6 title : required positional argument that specifies the search phrase sent to Torznab. --config PATH : alternate path to the JSON configuration file (defaults to config.json ). --download-dir DIR : temporary download directory that overrides the Transmission download_dir setting. --start / --no-start : force the torrent to start immediately or be added in a paused state. --use-rpc / --use-remote : switch between Transmission's RPC interface and the transmission-remote CLI regardless of what the configuration specifies. --host, --port : override the Transmission host and port when connecting over RPC or transmission-remote . --username, --password : credentials for Transmission RPC mode. --auth : user:pass combination for the transmission-remote CLI. --categories : replace the Torznab category filter for this run (comma-separated list). --category : friendly presets for common filters ( movies , tv , software , software-mac , software-win , all ). --debug : elevate logging to DEBUG regardless of the configuration. Category presets cheat sheet \u00b6 Preset Torznab IDs Example movies 2000 python main.py \"Dune\" --category movies tv 5000 python main.py \"The Bear\" --category tv software 4000 python main.py \"Blender\" --category software software-mac 4050 python main.py \"Final Cut\" --category software-mac software-win 4010,4020 python main.py \"Office\" --category software-win all (no filter) python main.py \"Dune\" --category all The presets simply override torznab.categories , so existing config values stay untouched for subsequent runs. Workflow tips \u00b6 Use the overrides to script batch downloads without touching config.json . Pair --debug with a temporary --download-dir when diagnosing indexer or Transmission issues. If transmission-remote is not found, toggle RPC mode with --use-rpc (requires transmission-rpc to be installed in the active environment). Telegram chat control \u00b6 A lightweight Telegram bot ships with the project for couch-friendly control: python telegram_bot.py --config config.json Flow: Send search Cowboy Bepop (or any search <keywords> query). Add an optional category keyword upfront\u2014 search movies dune , search tv s04 , search software mac final cut , or search all dune \u2014to reuse the CLI presets inside Telegram. The bot replies with the top five ranked results and seed/peer stats. Respond with the list number or tap the inline button to add that torrent to Transmission. Send status (or tap the Status button shown below each result set) to check active downloads; use status all when you want every torrent plus a quick read on its Transmission state (downloading, seeding, stopped, etc.). The bot auto-notifies you when a Telegram-triggered download finishes regardless. Populate the telegram section of config.json with your bot_token (and optional chat_id ) or override with --token / --chat-id . Tweak --max-results when you want more or fewer options. The bot shares the same config.json as the CLI, so keep your Torznab/Transmission settings up to date there. Kick the conversation off with /start to expose a compact reply keyboard that keeps Status/Help buttons handy for tap-friendly control. Commands recap - search <query> \u2013 runs a search; prepend the category keywords listed above for quick filters. - <number> or tapping the inline button \u2013 sends that specific result to Transmission. - status \u2013 displays active torrents (also exposed via the inline \u201c\ud83d\udce1 Status\u201d button). - status all \u2013 lists every torrent and adds a short explanation of each Transmission state. - help / /help \u2013 prints the command list again. !!! tip Auto-notifications for finished torrents rely on the Telegram JobQueue.
